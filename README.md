## 📋 Requirements

- **Node.js**: >= 22.13.0

## 🔧 Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd haruneko
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install

**Important:** Manga downloads require Chromium/Chrome for Puppeteer. If downloads fail, ensure you have Chrome or Chromium installed and set the `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` environment variable to its location.

#### 3. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file and customize:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your preferred settings:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
HOST=0.0.0.0
NODE_ENV=development

# Storage Paths
STORAGE_PATH=./storage

# Puppeteer Configuration
PUPPETEER_HEADLESS=true
PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/chromium  # Or your Chrome path
PUPPETEER_MAX_BROWSERS=5

# Download Configuration
MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS=3
DEFAULT_FORMAT=cbz
DOWNLOAD_RETENTION_DAYS=7

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

#### 4. Build the Project

```bash
npm run build
```

#### 5. Start the Server

**Development mode (with auto-reload):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production mode:**
```bash

This project is a fork of [HakuNeko](https://github.com/manga-download/haruneko) - the original manga downloader desktop application. The core manga scraping engine and 788+ website scrapers are from HakuNeko, with an added REST API layer to enable programmatic access and integration.

### Download Fails

1. Check source is still active: `GET /api/v1/sources/{sourceId}`
2. Verify chapter IDs are correct
3. Check logs for detailed error messages
4. Ensure sufficient disk space in `storage/` directory
